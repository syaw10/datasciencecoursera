INTRODUCTION
===================================================

This dataset was coded and compiled as fulfillment of a Data Science course withJohns Hopkins University.  Here, data provided by the instructor was downloaded, the data tables provided were merged and the labels reconfigured.  The function outputs a table Assignment4 that provides the print out of the cleaned up data.

FUNCTION: run_analysis
====================================================

The function run_analysis accomplishes the following criteria:

	1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
	4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
		activity and each subject.
